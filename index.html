<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
  <a href="newcomb.github.io/naturalgasstatebystate1.csv">Data Link</a>
  <div class="box">
  <h2>Explanation</h2>
  <p>While the data displayed in this table may seem hard to understand due to the sheer amount of it provided, it is displaying the amount of natural gas
     used in every state. Each row contains over 3 pieces of data with one being the name of the state. The data portrayed in this
    table interests me because it describes the market for natural gasses and shows the usage of them in today's society. Energy efficiency is
    becoming a major focus for scientists all around the world because natural gasses and other non-renewable sources are being constantly used
    to provide energy for the planet. Since these sources of energy will not last forever, it is important to find more efficient ways
    to use them or just come up with other sources of energy. This data is important to my cause of eventually being able to help reduce
    the amount of resources used by making more energy efficient power sources because in the future we will be able to compare the usage
    of natural gasses with the uses of the past to find out the positive or negative changes our new sources are having.</p>

  <h2>Why Energy Efficiency is Important to Me</h2>
  <p>Energy Efficiency is important to me because if we do not find ways to reduce our emissions and our usage of resources,
    eventually our children, or their children, or their children's children will not be able to live in a clean and functioning world.
    Whether it be that global warming slowly ruins humanities chances at survival or we just run out of ways to power the electric tools
    that we have become so accustomed to.</p>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <p>For my data I chose a table that meets all requirements of the prompt by displaying numerical data and uses strings. The table
  is also in CSV format and I described how to use it in efforts towards energy efficiency.</p>
